/**
 * Dedicated interface to handle all stored tree sessions. It is responsible to
 * handle sessions in the API.
 * 
 * <p>With the transaction, the API client can initialize, deactivate, activate,
 * retrieve or destroy any sessions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Structurally, this interface acts as a bridge between the 
 * {@link TreeManager} and the {@link TreeSession}, making inherent part of
 * session, handling the total responsibility of this class, leaving the
 * <code>TreeManager</code> interface free to just manipulate the elements
 * inside of the session.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An {@link Element} represents a node in a tree and a tree can only exist
 * within a previously created session. But to create a session, it is needed to
 * use an object that represents the session transaction, and this object is an
 * instance of this interface. However, a transaction only can be recovered from
 * within the <code>TreeManager</code> by invoking
 * {@link TreeManager#getTransaction()}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There are two ways of creating tree sessions:
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li>Create a new empty tree session;</li>
 * 		<li>Create a tree session from the <b>API Transformation Process</b>.
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ol>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>The first one happens when the API client just wants create a default
 * empty tree session by invoking {@link #initializeSession(String, Class)}.
 * Here an empty tree is created, specifying which type of class this session
 * will have as node.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The last one happens when an API client desire to transform a 
 * <code>Collection</code> of objects that represents a linear tree structure.
 * This transformation (which is called by API Transformation Process) converts
 * this linear structure into a real tree structure, which each node is
 * represented by an <code>Element</code> objects. This API Transformation
 * Process implements an internal life cycle.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>The <code>TreeTransaction</code> can only work with one
 * <code>TreeSession</code> per time, meanwhile the other sessions stay in
 * background waiting to be selected again in another time.</b></p>

	 * 		<li><b>Core Engine (with 3 sub-phases)</b></li>

	 * 		</tr>
	 * 	</table>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p><b>Pre-Validation:</b></p>
	 * <p>This phase represents the begin of the API Transformation Process. In
	 * this phase, the core API needs that all inputs aspects to be transformed
	 * need to conform. The following validations will be done:
	 * 
	 * 	<ul>
	 * 		<li>The <code>identifier</code> or <code>nodes</code> are
	 * 		<code>null</code> or <code>nodes</code> collection is empty;</li>
	 * 		<li>There is a existing session with the same identifier passed
	 * 		through;</li>
	 * 		<li>The node class to be transformed has the {@literal @Tree}
	 * 		annotation;</li>
	 * 		<li>The identifier attribute of the node to be transformed has
	 * 		the	{@literal @Id} annotation;</li>
	 * 		<li>The parent attribute of the node to be transformed has the
	 * 		{@literal @Parent} annotation;</li>
	 * 		<li>Verify whether the identifier attribute of each node is
	 * 		<code>null</code>;</li>
	 * 		<li>Validates whether all node objects have all of them the
	 * 		{@literal @Id} and {@literal @Parent} attributes with the same class
	 * 		type.
	 * 		</li>
	 * 	</ul>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p><b>Core Engine:</b></p>
	 * <p><i>Extraction:</i></p>
	 * <p>If all node requirements are right, then the tree assembly process
	 * will be carried out at this stage.</p>
	 * 	<ol>
	 * 		<li>Iterates over each node to be extracted;</li>
	 * 		<li>Creates a map to store these nodes and for each node:
	 * 		</li>
	 * 			<ol>
	 * 				<li>The key map will be the {@literal @Id} attribute value
	 * 				from the node object to be transformed;</li>
	 * 				<li>The value map will be the own node object to be
	 * 				transformed.</li>
	 * 			</ol>
	 * 	</ol>
	 * 
	 * <p><i>Initialization:</i></p>
	 * <p>After having filling out the map with stored nodes, then the API will
	 * iterate over it and for each node object:</p>
	 * <p>
	 * 	<ol>
	 * 		<li>Will instantiate an <code>Element</code> object;</li>
	 * 		<li>The element <code>id</code> attribute will be the corresponding
	 * 		identifier attribute of the source node to be transformed;</li>
	 * 		<li>The <code>parent</code> attribute of the element will be the
	 * 		corresponding parent attribute of the source node to be	transformed.
	 * 		</li>
	 * 	</ol>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p><i>Binding:</i></p>
	 * <p>Once having the resulting collection of initialized elements, the
	 * core API will bind each element and transform it into a parent-child
	 * relationship, where each element can contain multiple children within it
	 * and each child can have other children, and so on. That is done through
	 * the <code>id</code> attribute. So, for this work, the core API will seek
	 * for each element and:</p>
	 * <p>
	 * 	<ol>
	 * 		<li>Wraps the transformed node (the source object which it has the
	 * 		{@literal Tree}, {@literal Id} and {@literal Parent} annotations)
	 * 		into this own element;</li>
	 * 		<li>Puts this own element into another one, as child, compounding
	 * 		the <code>parent</code> attribute of the child with the
	 * 		<code>id</code> attribute of the parent element (<b>if the parent
	 * 		element is not found, then the element will be moved to the tree
	 * 		root level</b>);</li>
	 * 		<li>In the end, each element will contains other elements inside of
	 * 		it (as children), as a real tree structure of elements, ready to be
	 * 		handled.</li>
	 * 	</ol>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>So, the resulting <code>Element</code> object will have:</p>
	 * <p>
	 * 	<ul>
	 * 		<li>The <code>id</code> attribute value;</li>
	 * 		<li>The <code>parent</code> attribute value;</li>
	 * 		<li>The <code>wrappedNode</code> corresponding the source node
	 * 		object used in this transformation process;</li>
	 * 		<li>The collection of children elements;</li>
	 * 		<li>The tree session which this element belongs in.</li>
	 * 	</ul>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p><b>Post-Validation:</b></p>
	 * <p>In this phase, the core API will compare the resulting elements with
	 * the source node objects used in this transformation process. If there is
	 * a single difference, then a <codeTreeException</code> must be threw.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>this life cycle is only triggered in the API Transformation Process,
	 * by invoking this method, passing a collection of a linear structure to be
	 * transformed.</p>
