/**
 * An <code>Element</code> represents a node within a tree. It consists of the
 * elementary unit of the HappyTree API, which is directly handled through
 * {@link TreeManager} interface. An element can move from one tree to another,
 * be removed, copied and even encapsulate any object (node) within it, making
 * this encapsulated object hierarchically available within a tree structure.
 * 
 * <p>This interface is only responsible for handling the element itself and its
 * children only. Here, there is no direct relationship with the other available
 * interfaces, except its respective session ({@link TreeSession}) which this
 * element belongs in. Considering that, as an element corresponds to an
 * elementary unit, it is only possible to relate to itself and its children.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>An element <b>always</b> is associated with a session. Even after right
 * its creation, the element already belongs to a session, but thats not means
 * that this element is already in the tree. It depends on its life cycle state.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>To be handled, an element must be in an appropriate state in its life
 * cycle, depending on the operation that is desired to perform. Its life cycle
 * consists of 3 states:</p>
 * 
 * <table summary="Life cycle">
 * <tr><th>State</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 * 
 * <tr>
 * 		<td>NOT_EXISTED</td>
 * 		<td>When the element is created. At this time, the element was not
 * 			persisted inside the any tree session yet.
 * 		</td>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * <tr>
 * 		<td>ATTACHED</td>
 * 		<td>When the element is created and after that, the same is persisted
 * 			inside the tree session by invoking.
 * 		</td>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * <tr>
 * 		<td>DETACHED</td>
 * 		<td>When the element is already inside the tree as <i>ATTACHED</i> but
 * 			it got some change from the moment the API client has access to it.
 * 		</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * 
 * <p><b>Considering that, an element previously attached to some session, Each
 * subsequent manipulation from the perspective of the element itself will turn
 * its state to <code>DETACHED</code>, thus requiring an update by invoking
 * {@link TreeManager#updateElement(Element)}.</b></p>
 * 
 * <p>The API client has access to the following characteristics:</p>
 * 
 * <table summary="Characteristics">
 * 	<tr><th>Characteristics</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td><code>ID</code></td><td>The element identifier within the tree
 * 		(<b>must be unique within the tree</b>).</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td><code>Parent</code></td><td>The parent element within the tree (if
 * 		the parent element is not found or <code>null</code> then this element
 * 		will be moved to the tree root level).</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td><code>Children</code></td><td>The children list of the element.</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td><code>Wrapped Node</code></td><td>The encapsulated node.</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td><code>Session</code></td><td>The session which this element	belongs
 * 		in.</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td><code>Life Cycle</code></td><td>The current state in life cycle.
 * 		</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * </table>
 * 
 * <p>The relationship between {@literal Id} and {@literal Parent} in the
 * tree composition represents the heart of the HappyTree API. The tree is
 * assembled strictly by this relation, of which a parent of an element
 * references the id of the parent element. Therefore, an id of a element can
 * never be <code>null</code> and if a parent of an element is <code>null</code>
 * or not found, that same element is moved to the root level of the tree.</p>

	/**
	 * Encapsulates any object node within the element, as long as this object

	 * 
	 * <p>As an element conceptually represents a <i>node</i> within a tree, the
	 * wrapped object node would be simulating precisely its position within the
	 * tree in question.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The object node itself can be wrapped at two different times:</p>

	 * 		<li>Initializing a new empty tree session;</li>
	 * 		<li>Initializing a tree session from the <b>API Transformation
	 * 		Process</b>.</li>
	 * 	</ol>
	 * 
	 * <p>The first one would be to create an empty tree. In this way, the
	 * wrapped node is determined after the tree is ready, invoking this
	 * method. This includes the choice of not determining, making it with the
	 * <code>null</code> value.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The last one happens in the <b>API Transformation Process</b>, that
	 * is, when the moment of initialization, before the tree is created, a call
	 * for {@link TreeTransaction#initializeSession(String, Collection)}
	 * transforms a previous linear structure into a real hierarchical
	 * structure of a tree. Then, each <code>Element</code> object will wrap its
	 * respective node automatically.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Therefore, each object node of this linear structure would be
	 * represented precisely by this encapsulated object within its respective
	 * <code>Element</code> object in its respective hierarchy inside of the
	 * tree. In this case, during the <b>API Transformation Process</b> life
	 * cycle, the object node will be transformed, managed and wrapped within
	 * the own element automatically.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>There are some requirements for this object node to be wrapped when
	 * initializing a session by the API Transformation Process:</p>
	 * 	<ul>
	 * 		<li>The class of this node must be annotated by {@literal @Tree};
	 * 		</li>
	 * 		<li>The class of this node must be annotated by {@literal @Parent};
	 * 		</li>
	 * 		<li>The class of this node must be annotated by {@literal @Id};
	 * 		</li>
	 * 		<li>The {@literal @Id} value cannot be <code>null</code>;
	 * 		</li>
	 * 		<li>The {@literal @Id} and {@literal @Parent} must be of the same
	 * 		type.</li>
	 * 	</ul>
	 * 
	 * <p>Those requirements are only applied when the session is going to be
	 * initialized by the <b>API Transformation Process</b>.</p>
