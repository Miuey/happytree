# Code of Conduct

## Objective

Following the Open-Source atmosphere, this code of conduct aims to
define recommendations in order to guarantee the freedom of
collaborators to contribute, suggest and make use of the HappyTree
API, in order to respect all members of this community, making the
environment conducive to technological development and personal
spontaneously.

## Behavior Standards

The HappyTree community, living up to its name, believes that its
members are mature enough to be common sense, thus ensuring a
community that values full inclusion, respect and a spirit of
collaboration with their fellow humans. The HappyTree Community is
inspired by the purest behaviors of the Open-Source spirit, that are:
free integration among members, spontaneous collaboration and mutual
assistance between members, based on the pillars of respect and
common sense.

Here are some recommendations for keeping the community environment
pleasant:

* Use of inclusive language;
* Be respectful of the different points of view and previous
 experiences;
* Respect a point respectfully so as not to verbally attack others;
* Be able to criticize as well as receive criticism in a respectful
 manner;
* Stimulate learning;
* Showing empathy and patient with new members who do not yet know
 the spirit of the community.
 
The following are examples of behaviors that are not community
standards:

* Use of sexual language;
* Defamatory comments;
* Verbal aggressions/insults;
* Publication of private content or information without the express
 consent;
* Discrimination under any aspect towards others;
* Any other conduct that deviates from ethical and moral principles.

## Enforcement

If a member feels offended, he/she can report such occurrence through
the following email: contact@miuey.com.

The attacked person in question can be sure that his report will be
analyzed confidentially and totally impartial in light of the facts
found.
Warnings may be given to the aggressor and, if his behavior keeps not
compatible with the community's code of conduct, the aggressor may be
expelled from it.

The HappyTree community believes that these actions will never be
executed, precisely because it believes in the good faith of the
members.
